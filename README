YouTube MySongs

YouTube MySongs is an Android application that allows you to click on a song on your phone and it auto-magically plays the video from YouTube. You no longer need to go to YouTube and search for songs.
This is beta version. Coming soon: -- playlist support, search feature, and many more.
