YouTube MySongs

YouTube MySongs is an Android application that allows you to click on a song on the phone and it automatically plays the video from YouTube. It reads the meta data of the song and uses that to generate a search query on YouTube.
This is beta version. Coming soon: -- playlist support, search feature, and many more.
Download the app directly from Google play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aanchal.youtubemysongs&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5hYW5jaGFsLnlvdXR1YmVteXNvbmdzIl0..
